# Interactive

Interactive is a hobby project that I am working on. The main reason why I am working on this project is to create games with my own engine for GameJams.

Interactive is still on very early development. There are a lot of missing/not-optimized features.

## Finished Features Includes:
#### Entity-Component
#### Garbage Collection
#### Reflection
#### Scripting Language
#### Asset System
  ##### Asset Serialization / Deserialization
#### Rendering
#### Disk Reading
